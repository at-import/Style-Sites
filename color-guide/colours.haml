-# Set Up Your Colour Guide!
-#  The colour guide is set up to make your life easy by providing you a visual indicator of your colours. Simply add or change the names in the @colours variable to the variables you use in your style guide and update the @colourShades variable so the guide knows how many shades it needs to have in the HTML for each colour and you're set!
- @colours = ['black', 'red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'purple']
- @colourShades = 6
